# -TimeshareRoutineProject

## Description

The Time Sharing Routine project is a simulation program that replicates the execution of a series of interactive processes. The program simulates a time-sharing system, where multiple processes take turns utilizing the CPU in a cooperative manner. This project showcases the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a Java object to represent different processes and implementing a time-sharing routine.

## Developer

- **Duration:** Jan 2023 - Feb 2023

## Features

- The project focuses on simulating the execution of interactive processes in a time-sharing environment.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are applied in the design and development of the program.
- A Java object is created to represent distinct processes, each with its unique attributes.
- The implemented class in Java manages the execution of a time-sharing routine based on a list of process objects.
- This project provides insights into managing and scheduling processes in a cooperative CPU-sharing scenario.

## Usage

1. Compile and run the time-sharing simulation program.
2. Observe how the program simulates the execution of processes in a time-sharing manner.
3. Analyze the cooperative nature of the time-sharing routine and how different processes take turns using the CPU.

## Implementation Details

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is utilized in the design and implementation of the program.
- A Java object represents individual processes, capturing their characteristics.
- The program's core class manages the time-sharing routine by coordinating the execution of the list of process objects.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of advanced scheduling algorithms for a more comprehensive exploration of process management.
- Implementation of visualization tools to display the time-sharing process graphically.
